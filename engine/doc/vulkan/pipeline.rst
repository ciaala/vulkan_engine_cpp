Pipeline
--------

The pipeline of a GPU is made of a combination of fixed function and programmable stages.
Each stage receives an input data from the previous stage and produce an output data for the next stage.

A GPU contains 2 different functional pipelines one for the **Graphic** processing and the other to handle the **Compute** functionality.
Input and output data can be either an Image or a Buffer.
