1- Flow of Idea
===============

Player control a small snake that has to move around and eat some fruit and insect.
By eating the snake becomes bigger [v2-physics and more unresponsive and difficult to control].

The snake move around by turning left or right.

Fruits grow and fall from the trees and insects come out of the rocks and move around.

To move to the next level in the game he has to reach a specified length.

Each level there's a different layout of food and obstacles.

The obstacles are static layout elements.
We can make water and bridge that opens at specific time as time-dynamic space-static obstacles.
Exploding fruit can also be a game play element.
And some spitting around insect-enemy are slowly moving around their rock on the map.

[v2-open-world In the open world a small planet the snake moves around, there's also water to avoid but it produces frogs]

The snake can also shake its tail and gain extra speed for a while.

[v2 if the snake eat to much it acquire fat which makes him unresponsive and slower to move]
[v2 the snake can eat cakes from cake shop / or walking around kids]
[v2 every food has different quality]
[v2 the snake can be muscolar and so on]
[v2 staying in the sunny part makes the snake faster while staying in the dark world makes the snake slower]


Snake V2
========

A lot of idea come out for V2 design the main point is that V2 can be a kid oriented game on eating well.
If snakes are not interesting enough for V2 we can propose other animals.
We can also allow player to switch animals
