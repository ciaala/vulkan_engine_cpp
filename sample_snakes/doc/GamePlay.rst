1- Flow of Idea
===============

Player control a small snake that has to move around and eat some fruit and insect.
By eating the snake becomes bigger

The snake move around by turning left or right.

Fruits grow and fall from the trees and insects come out of the rocks and move around.

To move to the next level in the game he has to reach a specified length.

Each level there's a different layout of food and obstacles.

The obstacles are static layout elements.
We can make water and bridge that opens at specific time as time-dynamic space-static obstacles.
Exploding fruit can also be a game play element.
And some spitting around insect-enemy are slowly moving around their rock on the map.
The snake can also shake its tail and gain extra speed for a while.
