Brainstorm 2017 July 22th
=========================

The following section contains material for a following project-game based on the same topics

All those lines are ripped off by the brainstorm for the original sample-game: snake.

Idea
====

By eating the snake becomes bigger  [v2-physics and more unresponsive and difficult to control].


[v2-open-world In the open world a small planet the snake moves around, there's also water to avoid but it produces frogs]

[v2 if the snake eat to much it acquire fat which makes him unresponsive and slower to move]
[v2 the snake can eat cakes from cake shop / or walking around kids]
[v2 every food has different quality]
[v2 the snake can be muscular and so on]
[v2 staying in the sunny part makes the snake faster while staying in the dark world makes the snake slower]

Snake V2
========

A lot of idea come out for V2 design the main point is that V2 can be a kid oriented game on eating well.
If snakes are not interesting enough for V2 we can propose other animals.
We can also allow player to switch animals
