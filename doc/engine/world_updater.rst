Scene Updater
-------------

Scene Updater does not check space area
scene updater scales x core and updates in parallel each objects

if objects is drawable
  if we have area visibility checks or object visibility
    if object resources are not ready
      we can already enque drawable objects resource loading





Visibility Checks
=================
and it should be fast enough to be done in single thread it should be really not meaningful to do the check
